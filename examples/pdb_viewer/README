PDB viewer using OpenGL

Taken from OpenGL-Simple-Viewer-0.03 by Jonathan Chin.

Based on an example by Simon Cozens, published on The Perl Journal (Cozens, S.
Molecular Biology With Perl. The Perl Journal 2004, 8[8], 15-19).

Note: this requires additonal modules such as OpenGL::Simple::Viewer, which may
not be easy to install (I have only been able to make it work under Linux). The
code itself is more useful as an OpenGL tutorial than as a PerlMol tutorial,
but I include it as it may be of interest to PerlMol users.
