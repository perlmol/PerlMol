PerlMol EXAMPLES

This directory contains some sample scripts using PerlMol. Most of them have
been sumbitted or suggested by PerlMol users; if you have something that you can
share and could be educational, please send it (itub@cpan.org)! The ideal
example is relatively short (about 100 lines), self-contained, and does
something potentially useful.
