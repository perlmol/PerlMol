PerlMol version 0.2300
======================

PerlMol is a collection of Perl modules for chemoinformatics and computational
chemistry with the philosophy that "simple things should be simple". It should
be possible to write one-liners that use this toolkit to do meaningful
"molecular munging". The perlmol toolkit provides objects and methods for
representing molecules, atoms, and bonds in Perl; doing substructure matching;
and reading and writing files in various formats.

This is a bundle containing all of the modules of the PerlMol Project and their
dependencies.
